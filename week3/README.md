During the process of creating a slideshow of images, I encountered the following problems:
Difficulty in making the images appear: There was a struggle to display the images properly within the slideshow. This issue was because of incorrect file formats, and errors in the slideshow code.

Sizing of the pictures: Another challenge I faced was with the sizing of the pictures within the slideshow. Adjusting the dimensions of the images to fit the desired layout or aspect ratio proved to be problematic.
